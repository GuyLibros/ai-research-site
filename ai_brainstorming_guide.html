    <h1>🧠 Brainstorm & Refine Research Questions with AI</h1>
    <p>Learn how AI tools can help you find, narrow, and shape your research topic.</p>
  </header>

  <main class="container">
    <section>
      <h2>✅ 1. Brainstorm Broad Topics</h2>
      <p>You can start with a general idea and ask AI to help break it down into potential research areas.</p>
      <strong>Example prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"I'm interested in climate change. What are some academic research angles I could explore?"</code></pre>
      <p>💡 AI might respond with ideas like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The impact of climate change on coastal communities</li>
        <li>Youth climate activism in different countries</li>
        <li>Misinformation about climate science on social media</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 2. Narrow a Topic to a Manageable Focus</h2>
      <p>If your topic feels too broad, AI can help you filter it down based on scope, audience, method, or timeframe.</p>
      <strong>Prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"Help me narrow down a research question about social media and mental health that would work for a 10-page paper."</code></pre>
      <p>💡 AI might return:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How does TikTok usage affect sleep patterns in college students?</li>
        <li>What role does social media play in shaping body image among teenagers?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 3. Explore Unfamiliar Angles</h2>
      <p>AI can help you see your topic through different lenses: sociological, ethical, technological, or historical.</p>
      <strong>Prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"What are some ethical issues I could explore related to AI in education?"</code></pre>
      <p>💡 Results might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI bias in grading and feedback tools</li>
        <li>Data privacy in student AI usage</li>
        <li>Teacher dependence on AI-generated content</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 4. Turn a Topic into a Research Question</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve picked a topic, you can ask AI to help you phrase it as an effective research question.</p>
      <strong>Prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"Turn this into a research question: the rise of remote work after COVID-19."</code></pre>
      <p>💡 Example results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the long-term effects of remote work on productivity in the tech industry?</li>
        <li>How has remote work reshaped urban migration trends post-COVID?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 5. Compare and Refine Multiple Versions</h2>
      <p>You can even ask the AI to compare or rank options for originality, focus, or clarity.</p>
      <strong>Prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"Here are 3 versions of my research question. Which one is the strongest and why?"</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 6. Connect Class Readings to Topics</h2>
      <p>Use AI to turn books or course themes into research ideas.</p>
      <strong>Prompt:</strong>
      <pre><code>"Based on this summary of *Just Mercy*, what are some research questions I could explore related to justice and incarceration?"</code></pre>
      <p>💡 Tip: Paste in a short passage if you're using a specific reading.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✅ 7. Try These Prompts on Your Own</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“Give me 5 research questions about [topic].”</li>
        <li>“What are the emerging trends in [field]?”</li>
        <li>“How can I turn this broad idea — [your idea] — into something more specific?”</li>
        <li>“What’s a unique angle on [topic] that hasn’t been overdone?”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧰 Tools to Use for This</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4)</strong> — for creative phrasing and outlining</li>
        <li><strong>Claude</strong> — for a more conversational and exploratory tone</li>
        <li><strong>Perplexity.ai</strong> — for blending brainstorming with cited source discovery</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>⚠️ Academic Integrity and Citation Help</h2>
      <p>AI tools are just one part of your research journey. You still need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluate sources</li>
        <li>Verify facts</li>
        <li>Avoid plagiarism</li>
        <li>Cite your sources properly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use tools like Zotero, Purdue OWL, or citation generators (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago).<br>
      When in doubt, ask your professor or a librarian at <strong>Legacy Library</strong>.</p>
