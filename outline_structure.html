      <h2>📋 Sample Output</h2>
      <p><strongPrompt:</strong> <em>"Based on the question, suggest a 5-paragraph outline with topic sentences."</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Appalachian geography played a central role in shaping the cultural and social identity of rural Western Maryland during the 19th century.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> The region’s mountainous landscape created geographic isolation that reinforced tight-knit rural communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> Isolation also shaped unique religious and cultural practices distinct from urban and coastal Maryland.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Economic opportunities, such as coal mining and subsistence farming, were shaped by the land and influenced rural identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Geography was more than background — it was a defining force in shaping identity, tradition, and daily life.</li>
